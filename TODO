* Worry about numerical stability in intersects()
* Auto-derive sensible tolerance value from input parameters
  * Permit a snap-to-grid instead of just Euclidean distance? [DONE]
  * Check if there is loss in int/double conversion in the point factory
* Doesn't detect (much less handle) line segments that intersect in more than one pathpoint (ie parallel and overlapping)
* Link test code only for debug builds (or use a test framework like gtest?)
* Prevent code outside of the pathpoint factory generating points?
* Error messages should be a bit more informative - like where in the data the error was found
* When stepping the world iterator over all line segments, inside a path the next segment will always meet the previous in their single shared point.
  Thus, for the purposes of finding unknown intersections between segments, one can always skip the next one unless it belongs to another path.
* Create large example with 10**6 polygons or so, for performance testing and profiling [DONE]
* The "unused path" test is not good enough to catch all polygons, only all paths
