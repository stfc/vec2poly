* Worry about numerical stability in intersects()
* Auto-derive sensible tolerance value from input parameters
  * Permit a snap-to-grid instead of just Euclidean distance?
* Doesn't detect (much less handle) line segments that intersect in more than one pathpoint (ie parallel and overlapping)
* Link test code only for debug builds (or use a test framework like gtest?)
* Prevent code outside of the pathpoint factory generating points?
* Error messages should be a bit more informative - like where in the data the error was found
